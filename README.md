# Tenzies Game

A dice game. Fill the board with the same number to win.<br />

The game is made using React. Features include:

* **Roll:** This button allows users to shuffle the die that are not selected green.

* **10, 15, 20:** These buttons allow the user to change the size of the board.

* **Rolls:** This display counts the amount of rolls the user is on during the current game.

* **Highscore:** This display uses local storage to store the users highscore or the least amount of rolls that were needed to win.

***Die.js*** is a component that contains the function needed to create each individual die on the board. <br />
***App.js*** is responsible for initializing the board, executing the game, and completing/restarting the game.
